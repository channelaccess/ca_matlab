# Overview
This directory contains some examples on how to use this library.

To execute the examples, just copy the latest version of the library jar in place, eventually adapt the version of the import and execute the examples.

__Note__: If you are not within PSI, of course you have to adapt the channel to a channel you can reach.

# Examples
# Getting Started
`getting_started.m` shows the most basic commands required to use the library.

# Grouping Channels
`example_channel_group.m` outlines how to group channels nicely inside a class that later can be used for accessing channels.
The advantage of such a grouping of channels is, given the class is implemented correctly, that channels can be easily and cleanly created and closed.

# Example GUI
`example_gui.m` shows how to easily write a Matlab GUI showing the actual value of a channel.
